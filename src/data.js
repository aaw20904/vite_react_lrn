         Surrounded by majestic mountain peaks, 800-metre-high cliffs and cascading waterfalls, the UNESCO-listed fjord 
        is an impressive 15 kilometres long and 260 metres deep.
        Some of the fjord's most-visited attractions are its impressive falls, namely Seven Sisters,
         the Suitor and the Bridal Veil. You also shouldn't miss a visit to Ørneveien (the Eagle Road), where you can catch a magnificent view over the fjord itself.`,
